#Takeaways 

- Application run on the jdk1.8,0_151, that needs modification for the facets in core.xml.
- Goal set to Master and Visa card, however it will validate the other card providers as well.
- IP2Geo convertor sometimes gives the country code null.
- IP2Geo service require licence without get interrupted  response. 
- CreditCardValidator service gives more methods like debit network id using the card number for possible transaction process.
